## What is WebPlex?
WebPlex is a search engine designed to search and index files hosted among freely available web servers. It communicates with our own [public Json database](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ucyeqfn96x7n9lh/open-files.json?dl=0), which is updated daily by our robots that crawl through free access internet resources to list the best quality files it finds. All resources are available for everyone to browse in our [open directories file](https://github.com/invu/WebPlex/tree/master/api), where users can submit open web directories. WebPlex hosts no content, we provide only access to already available files in a same way Google and other search engines do.

## Some Features Available
 * User-friendly interface with searches at lightning speed
 * Multilingual support - contributions are welcome!

## Creating an issue
Please supply as much information about the problem you are experiencing as possible. Your issue has a much greater chance of being resolved if logs are supplied so that we can see what is going on. Creating an issue with '### isn't working' doesn't help anyone to fix the problem.

## Contributing
All contributions are welcome just send a pull request. WebPlex's directory database allows our team (and any other volunteering dev) to implement new indexers in a few seconds. If you'd like support for a new indexer but are not a developer then feel free to leave a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/invu/webplex/issues). It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2017 when making code changes in this project. You can download the community version for free [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
